**ENI vs ENA vs EFA**

- ENI - network interface. can be attached detached etc.
    - Addresses
        - A primary private IPv4 adress from the IPv4 range of the VPC
        - One ore more secondary IPv4 addresses from the VPC range
        - One EIP per private IPv4 address
        - One public IPv4 address
        - One or more IPv6 addresses
        - One or more SG
        - A MAC address
    - Scenarios
        - Management network
        - Use network and security appliances in your VPC
        - Create dual homes instances with workloads.roles on distinct subnets
        - Create a low budget high availability solution
- EN - enhanced networking
    - Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) - higher IOP performance and lower CPU utilization, compared to traditional ENI
    - Good network performance
    - Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) - up to 100Gbps
    - Virtual Function (VF) interface - up to 10Gbps. Older instances. ENA preferred
- EFA - elastic fabric adapter. Can be attached to ec2 instances to allow high performance computing (HPC) / machine learning
    - HPC & machine learning applications
    - Providers lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud based HPC systems
    - Can use OS-bypass - enables HPC and ML applications to bypass the OS kernel to communicate directly with the EFA device. It makes it a lot faster with a lot lower latency. Only linux
