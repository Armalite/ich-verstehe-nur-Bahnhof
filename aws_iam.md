**IAM**

- Users, Groups, Roles, Policies
- Universal, not regional
- Root account is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account
- New users have **no permission**Â when first created
- New Users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys when first created - for API / CLI, not console
    - Can only view once. Save in secure location. Otherwise must regenerate them
